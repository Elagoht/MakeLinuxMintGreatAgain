# MAKE LINUX MINT GREAT AGAIN

Run every line one by one. Do not make this file executable. Copy and paste every line (you wanted to apply.).

This commands are what I do after every fresh Linux Mint Cinnamon install. I often do distro-hopping and switch back to Linux Mint again and again and again. (Arch is the best distor btw.)

So I wanted to create a file to list all of the things I do. This file includes cinnamon settings, wallpapers, nemo actions, removing bloatwares, installing apps that I often use, setting wallpaper and themes, adding some useful shortcuts and adding swap area. You don't have to apply everything. You can inspire or learn something on this sheet.

Hope you love it.

There are some todos in this todo list.
